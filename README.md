## Introduction
Our project aims to address a challenge faced by Graintec A/S, a company that specializes in aquaculture technology. According to our contact at Graintec, the current method for gathering and storing information about projects and suppliers is inefficient and cumbersome, involving a large volume of documents. The main focus of the project will be on streamlining Graintec's sourcing process, which is the main source of the problem.
